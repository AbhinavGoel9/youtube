_**1.**  Thanks for coming & caring! Before submitting, please check if the issue has already been reported ever. With  [GitHub's issue search (use this link)](https://github.com/ImprovedTube/ImprovedTube/issues?q=)  (else removing "is:issue is:open" from the standard search)_ -->

_**2.** If you find the issue you can answer/react there to give it your voice (or just say hello :) ),_ 
 - _If the status is  "closed" (=fixed) recently, then Web Stores might also be updated soon - if 
    it was closed month or years ago, then it reappeared and must be fixed again._

**3. To find the bug: Can you ...?:**
  - ...log out? (maybe YouTube is testing a new version while you are logged in)
  - ...deactivate all other extensions running on YouTube? (or use an incognito window after activating this extension to run there  / _chrome://extensions `details`    chrome://extensions/?id=bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd_ )
  -  ...open the Browser-console, with the F12-Key, before/when the error occures?  (then hopefully you'll see an error message in the console). 
     -  ..._copy&paste (or screenshot) the YouTube-DOM shown above the console, just in case YouTube is giving you another version._
