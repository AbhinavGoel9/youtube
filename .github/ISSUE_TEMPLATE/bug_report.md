## Bug Report:
 ⚬ **BUG**:   <!-- (a clear/concise description) -->
 ⚬ **HOW**:   <!-- Steps to **reproduce** the Bug. ( Might require your specific combination of browser, versions, extensions, settings ) -->
⚬ If a YouTube change started the bug, please copy the DOM you get (especially if the bug doesn't happen when you log out or on another computer)
   ⚬ Or did our last update start the bug? 
       ⚬  ImprovedTube Version: __    <!--  [ written at the top, in the stores & under our ⋮ icon>settings>version]   -->

<!-- ( You can click:"PREVIEW"  to understand this template ) -->
**1.**  Thanks for coming & caring! Before submitting, please check if the issue has already been reported ever. With  [GitHub's issue search (use this link)](https://github.com/ImprovedTube/ImprovedTube/issues?q=)  _(else removing "is:issue is:open" from the standard search)  ( -  If it was posted before, you can answer/react there to give it your voice and move it up in the lists)  ( -  If the status is  "closed" (=fixed) recently, then Web Stores can be updated soon - if  it was closed month or years ago, then it might reappeared & must be fixed again.)_

**2. To give us a chance to solve the bug: Can you ...?:**
      - ..deactivate other extensions running on YouTube? (or use an incognito window after activating this extension to run there  / _chrome://extensions `details`    chrome://extensions/?id=bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd_ )
        -  ..open the Browser-console, with the `F12`-Key, before/when the error occures?  (then hopefully you'll see an error message in the console). 
       -  ...copy the YouTube-DOM shown above the console  (`F12`) in case YouTube is giving you a new verson.  You can copying the root element `<html>` in the top after the bug happened: 
![chrome](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/assets/25022245/ab976601-516a-40ad-970a-a5dbfc490c06) 
 ![Firefox](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/assets/25022245/d5c2cd43-b77c-4c65-b9ba-cb6e85a18d9c)
    - There are 2-3 different versions depending if you open a new window or clicked a link on youtube
